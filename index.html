They are sorted by both an 'importance' rating and a 'quality' or completeness rating. They also help users identify newly-created 'unassessed' articles in need of a quality or an 'importance' rating. Any editor can contribute to this process at any time.

    <p class="details" id="project2Details">The pages of a WikiProject are the central place for editor collaboration on a particular topic area. Editors there develop criteria, maintain various collaborative processes and keep track of work that needs to be done. It also provides a venue where issues of interest to the editors of a subject may be discussed. WikiProjects often write advice for editors, use bots to track what is happening at articles of interest to the group, and create lists of tools and templates the project's participants commonly use.
        The discussion pages attached to a project page are a convenient venue for those involved in that project to talk about what they are doing, to ask questions, and to receive advice from other people interested in the group's work. Participants in WikiProjects also assist in performing quality assessments of articles pertaining to their specific topic area..</p>
